**Assignment #3**

**Introduction:**
For this assignment, you will continue to use WACCM data, but you will begin to learn how to parse data by seasons. 

**Task:**
Your assignment is to (1) create a 2006-2099 annual average global Mollweide map plot, (2) create a line plot of annual average global time series weighted by latitude, (3) create a line plot of global average temperature anomalies weighted by latitude with a baseline of 2006-2035, and (4) repeat steps 2 and 3 for each season (Spring: March-April-May, Summer: June-July-August, Autumn: Sept-Oct-Nov, Winter: Dec-Jab-Feb) with each season in a subplot.

It is recommended that you try to create this plot before checking the answer script.
