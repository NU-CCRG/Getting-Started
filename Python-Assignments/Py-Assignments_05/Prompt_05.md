In this assignment we will explore the Array of Things dataset. In particular, we will explore the pre-processed reduced dataset in the folder `/projects/b1045/AoT/AoT_reduced_data_10m`

To help us explore the dataset, and learn `pandas` and a little bit of `cartopy` while exploring, let's try to answer the following questions.

1. How many types of sensors are available in the AoT? What are they?
2. How many nodes are there in the AoT? List all the node ids.
3. Do all stations have the same set of sensors?
4. What node is closest to where you live?
5. What sensors are available in that node?
6. What is the time period of the data availability of a sensor in that node?
7. Plot a time series of any available sensor in the node closest to you.
8. Plot the map of locations of 4 sensors.
