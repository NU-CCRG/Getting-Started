# How to Back Up your scripts

In the world of HPC bad stuff happens. User error or machine failure can result in the loss of the scripts you created. To prevent this, back up your intellectual creations, i.e., script. 

Scripts are files you create to analyze data. This includes everything that is not reproducable. I.e., this does not include ESM model code or data, or publicly available data downloads. ESM model code can be re-downloaded. Model simulations can be re-run. Model data and observations can be re-downloaded.
